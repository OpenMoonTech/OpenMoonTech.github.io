# Welcome

Its Ed from 10:34PM on a Thursday night.

Considered a million options, and decided to go old school w/ Jekyll.

Anyways, important part is it has 
[advanced code highlights, video embeds, and a lot more!](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/)

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Temp -Include *.* -File -Recurse | foreach { $_.Delete()}
```

This is all in Markdown, really easy to write!

```bash
rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
```
{: file="/var/www/php_nightmare/team-i-made-some-update-to-our-servers.sh" }

Blah blah blah

```javascript
parseInt(0.5);        // => 0
parseInt(0.05);       // => 0
parseInt(0.005);      // => 0
parseInt(0.0005);     // => 0
parseInt(0.00005);    // => 0
parseInt(0.000005);   // => 0
parseInt(0.0000005);  // => 5

parseInt("f*ck", 16); // -> 15
```

## Header 2

Has SEO stuff, CDN support, diagram and other things I'm too tired to think of.

Sigma male `vim macro` ***BASED*** grindset videos here:

# Header 1

Take a look at its [typography options, they're sick!](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/)

That's all I got for now, bed time.
